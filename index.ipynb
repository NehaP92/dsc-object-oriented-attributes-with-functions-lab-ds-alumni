    "In the last lesson, you saw what a **domain model** is and how it ties into object-oriented programming. In this lab, you'll be using a school as a domain model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a domain model using OOP\n",
    "* Create instance methods that operate on instance attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Simple School Class\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, open up the **school.py** file in your text editor of choice such as Atom, Sublime, or a simple notepad program. Within this file, create a `School()` class definition that will be initialized with the name of the school.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** the next cell imports an extension, `autoreload`, from IPython. The autoreload extension reloads any imported packages when methods from that package are called. While this is inefficient for stable packages such as NumPy which will be static while working in a notebook, the `autoreload` extension is quite useful when developing a package yourself. That is, you can update a package such as **school.py** and then test the effects in a notebook; with the `autoreload` extension, you'll see the effects of your changes to the package reflected. \n",
    "\n",
    ">> If you still have trouble with cells reflecting updates to the **school.py** file as you go along, go to the *Kernel* tab at the top of the Jupyter notebook and click *Restart & Run All*. This should smoothly run everything up to where you're working."
